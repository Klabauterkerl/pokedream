# PokéDream

After binging Pokémon content, where you spent all your free time playing the games, watching the anime, and collecting the cards, you realize that something has changed about you.

Now every time you close your eyes you think about these little critters. Every time a bush is rustling in your peripheral vision you prepare yourself for battle. You even started to see Pokémon in your everyday life, imagining that the birds outside their window were Pidgeys and the squirrels in the park were Pikachu.

But what is most affected are your dreams. No matter the story, it is always about Pokémon. But as dreams are they blend everything together, sometimes the Pokémon speak, sometimes they do cruel things no Pokémon in their right mind would do.

Now another restless dreamfilled night begins as you close your eyes...
